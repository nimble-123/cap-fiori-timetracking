      You are assisting a Product Owner preparing delivery artefacts for the CAPture Time project.
      Context summary:
        - Backend: SAP CAP, TypeScript, strict Clean Architecture with commands, validators, services, repositories resolved via ServiceContainer.
        - Frontend: Dual strategy with Fiori Elements (annotations-driven) and custom UI5 (TypeScript controllers/views).
        - Core features: time entry CRUD, balance tracking, bulk generation with holiday integration, attachments, customizable defaults.
        - Quality gates: maintainability (feature ≤ 2 dev days), testability (commands/services mockable), performance (mass generation < 2s), TypeScript strictness, usability (booking < 30s).
      Always connect functional scope to architecture layers, test strategy, and documentation updates.

      Create a delivery-ready story bundle for this refined requirement:

      "{{requirement_summary}}"

      Output the following:
        - User Story statement (role, goal, benefit).
        - Success Metrics and leading indicators.
        - Acceptance Criteria as Given/When/Then scenarios aligned with CAP events (before/on/after) and UI5 behavior.
        - Impacted Artifacts (commands, services, repositories, CDS entities, annotations, UI modules).
        - Technical Considerations (DI registrations, error handling, validation, performance, localization, logging).
        - Test Plan (unit, integration, E2E/UI5, manual REST client steps).
        - Documentation & ADR actions (README, ARCHITECTURE, ADRs, i18n assets).
        - Open Questions & Risks that require PO follow-up.

      Ensure the bundle can be handed to the development squad without further clarification.
